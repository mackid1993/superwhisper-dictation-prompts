# superwhisper-dictation-prompts
This is a repository for my (Superwhisper)[https://superwhisper.com] dictation prompts. So far I just have one on here that I find works pretty well.

- # Claude 4 Sonnet - Accuracy - Speech to Emoji - Internet Slang
  - This allows for dictation of Emojis
  - Dictation of common internet slang: eg. "ftw", "lol", "lmao", "rofl". Say the letters and they will be output in lowercase.
  - It has a high focus on accuracy
  - It works best with Claude 4 Sonnet and has been validated in Superwhisper
