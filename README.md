# superwhisper-dictation-prompts
This is a repository for my [Superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com) dictation prompts. XML headers are not included due to them not really being needed for the models to process. My goal is as little information in context as needed.

-  [**Claude 4 Sonnet - Accuracy - Speech to Emoji - Internet Slang**](https://github.com/mackid1993/superwhisper-dictation-prompts/blob/a6d0d14650c6798665b065970111e2c705593da3/Prompts/Claude%204%20Sonnet%20-%20Accuracy%20-%20Speech%20to%20Emoji%20-%20Internet%20Slang.xml)
    - This allows for dictation of Emojis.
    - Dictation of common internet slang: eg. "ftw", "lol", "lmao", "rofl". Say the letters and they will be output in lowercase.
    - It has a high focus on accuracy.
    - It works best with Claude 4 Sonnet and has been validated in Superwhisper.
